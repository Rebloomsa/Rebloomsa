### Day 1 — Monday 17 Feb | LAUNCH DAY
**Time:** 08:00 SAST
**Platforms:** Facebook + Instagram + X
**Content:** Founder Story (Post 1)

> I built Rebloom SA because I watched my mother navigate one of the most difficult journeys anyone can face — finding connection again after losing my father.
>
> After his passing, I saw her struggle with loneliness and the desire for companionship. The existing options felt wrong — impersonal, unsafe, or simply not designed for someone in her situation.
>
> So I built Rebloom. A private, verified community exclusively for widows and widowers in South Africa.
>
> Every member is personally reviewed. Every profile is real. Every conversation is safe.
>
> If you or someone you love is on this journey, Rebloom is here.
>
> 🌸 www.rebloomsa.co.za
> Free to join during early access.

## TIPS

- **Best times for SA:** 08:00 (morning commute), 12:00 (lunch), 18:00 (after work)
- **Always include the link:** www.rebloomsa.co.za in every post
- **Use images:** Posts with images get 2-3x more engagement. Use warm, hopeful imagery (nature, sunrise, flowers)
- **Engage with comments:** Reply to every comment personally as Darryl
- **Cross-post wisely:** X posts should be shorter. Instagram needs images. Facebook can be longer.
- **Track signups:** Check admin dashboard daily during launch week
